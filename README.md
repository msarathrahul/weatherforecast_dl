# Weather Forecasting with Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Conv1D (1D Convolutional Neural Networks), for weather forecasting. By leveraging these neural network architectures, we aim to predict weather-related variables such as temperature and pressure.

## Introduction

Weather forecasting is a critical aspect of modern life, impacting agriculture, transportation, and disaster preparedness. Traditional weather forecasting methods rely on numerical models and historical data. However, deep learning techniques offer the potential to improve forecast accuracy by capturing complex patterns and dependencies in the data.

In this project, we explore the use of LSTM and Conv1D neural networks to predict weather variables like temperature and pressure. These models can analyze historical weather data and make short-term and long-term forecasts, aiding in various applications such as agriculture, energy management, and disaster response.

## Data

The success of deep learning models for weather forecasting depends on the quality and quantity of data. We typically use historical weather data from sources like meteorological stations, satellites, and weather sensors. This data includes variables like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and more.

The dataset used in this project consists of historical weather measurements, including temperature and pressure. It is preprocessed to create input and target sequences suitable for training LSTM and Conv1D models.

## Techniques

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequential data, making it ideal for time series forecasting. It can capture long-term dependencies in the data, making it useful for predicting weather patterns.

### Conv1D (1D Convolutional Neural Network)

Conv1D applies convolutional filters to 1D sequences, making it useful for extracting spatial patterns in sequential data. In weather forecasting, Conv1D can help capture local variations and patterns in weather variables.

## Usage

To use the weather forecasting models:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecast-deep-learning.git`
2. Install the required dependencies (see the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section).
3. Preprocess your weather data to match the input format expected by the models.
4. Train the LSTM and Conv1D models using your preprocessed data.
5. Use the trained models to make weather forecasts.

## Results

The effectiveness of the LSTM and Conv1D models in weather forecasting depends on various factors, including data quality, model architecture, and hyperparameters. It is essential to evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

In this project, we achieve promising results in weather forecasting accuracy, as evidenced by the comparison of predicted vs. actual weather variables in our visualizations.
